# CSS Grid Layout (a.k.a Grid)

## Introduction
- Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional, Grid is a two-dimensional grid based layout specification. It gives us the ability to setup a grid and place elements on it with precision.
- Similar to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesnâ€™t matter. Placement is declared in CSS making it easy to rearrange based on viewport size.
- CSS Grid allows us to decouple layout definition from markup (e.g., bootstrap grid's `.row > .col-md-1` etc.)
